<h1>Ingredients in Lemon Cake</h1>

<h3>Here are the ingredients required for the signature, soft and fluffy Lemon Cake Layers! The Vanilla Cake post on which
this batter is based already has additional detail about some of the ingredients, which I won’t repeat in full here.</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Lemon zest and juice – Powers the lemon flavour! Most of the lemon flavour comes from the zest, while the tartness comes from the juice.</li>
        
    <li> Natural lemon extract (oil), OPTIONAL – Made from lemons, this is a concentrated oil that gives this cake a little extra lemon flavour leg-up. No matter how much fresh lemon you put in a cake batter, I find you can never achieve the quite same flavour intensity you can with just a a small amount of lemon extract (we just use 1/4 teaspoon).</li>
        
    <li>It comes in little bottles like food colouring, found in the same baking section of stores. However, if you don’t want to get a bottle especially for this cake, I do get that. So just skip it – I promise this cake still has sufficient lemon flavour!</li>
        
    <li>Flour – Just plain/all-purpose flour works better here than cake flour. However, if you can only get cake flour, that works just fine. The only difference is that the cake surface becomes a bit tacky the next day (not really a big deal inthis frosted cake) </li>
        
    <li>Sugar – Superfine / caster sugar is best as it dissolves more readily. But ordinary granulated white sugar is fine too. Please do not attempt to substitute with brown sugar or any sugar substitutes;</li>
        
    <li>Butter – Unsalted, the default for baking;</li>
        
    <li>Eggs – Fresher is better, and at room temperature. Fresh eggs fluff better, and room temperature eggs fluff faster than fridge-cold eggs. If you don’t know how, here’s how to check how fresh your eggs are;</li>
        
    <li>Milk, full-fat – Just plain old cow’s milk! Low-fat does work too but rises marginally less. Do not substitute with non-dairy milk or buttermilk;</li>
        
    <li>Baking powder – For lifting power. If you don’t use yours regularly, make sure sure it’s still good. Inactive baking powder is a common hidden culprit of cake fails;</li>
        
    <li>Vanilla – For its beautiful flavour which complements the lemon so well;
        
    <li>Salt – Just a little brings out the flavours of everything else in the cake; and</li>
        
    <li>Oil – For a touch of extra moisture but more importantly, it keeps the cake fresh for 5 days. Any neutral oil works fine here – vegetable, canola, peanut etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to make Lemon Cake</h1>

<h3>The batter for this cake is based on my Vanilla Cake. There, I’ve already provided comprehensive process steps as well as the “why” in the method. Rather than repeating it all, I’ll focus on the essentials relevant to this particular cake.</h3>
